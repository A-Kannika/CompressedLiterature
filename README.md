# Compressed Literature Program version 1
Compressed Literature Program version 1 is a project for Data Structure course | TCSS 342 | @the University of Washington Tacoma
<br/>
Compressed Literator 1 Program uses my own Minimum Heap Data Structure, Priority Queue, and Huffman Compression Algorithm.

## Description
This program compresses data from Leo Tolstoyâ€™s War and Peace literature consisting of over 3 million characters 
and writes it in a binary file format. Implement the MyPriorityQueue using an array-based or 
ArrayList-based implementation of a minimum heap. Encoder class is used to compress the characters file into the binary file, 
and Decoder class is used to uncompress the binary file back to the characters file.

## Getting Started
- Build the minimum heap data structure.
- Use a priority queue efficiently.
- Build and traverse a Huffman tree.
- Implement the Huffman compression algorithm.
- Write a binary file.
- Write decoder class to uncompressed the binary file to characters file.

## The result of the Compressed Literator Program version 1: 
- Compressed characters file from 3214 Kb to 1832 Kb in a binary file format with less than 1 second running time.
